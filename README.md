A silly WinForms game

I actually wrote this game a year or two ago. It was a fun exercise and I was always pretty happy with how it turned out.

Gameplay is intentionally ridiculously simple. There are a total of four buttons on the form, is all. You can "Look For Trouble", which causes you to encounter a randomly-generated monster. You can then "Attack" the monster or "Flee" from it. If your health gets low, you can click "Drink Potion" and get back to full health. You automatically recover one HP every thirty seconds and the potion takes one hour to refill.

The application will accept button presses as well as mouse clicks, so you can press "L" to look for trouble, "A" to attack, "F" to flee, or "D" to drink your potion. If you're really in a hurry, just press "P" (for "play") and the game will do whatever is the logical next step. So if you want to just run through the game and ignore all my clever encounter verbs and monster descriptors, just hold down "P" and off you go!

I suppose I ought to include a screenshot or something in here but I don't know how to do that yet, so maybe later. Please have fun and let me know if you have any questions!
